# Glossary

**Branch** - A version of the code. In Git, branches are like branches of a tree, where they can contain changes of the code with their own commits. These branches can [merge](#Merge) with other branches and settle the changes onto a desired branch.

**Clone** - Download a full copy of a given [branch](#Branch)

**Commit** - To save a change and publish it online on a [branch](#Branch)

**Merge** - To combine two [branches](#Branch) or versions of the code into one of the two branches with the user desired combinations of the two versions.

**Push** - Upload any latest changes that come from a local machine (users' own machine) into a [branch](#Branch) of the [repo](#Repository). While this can upload proposed changes into a [PR](#Pull_Request), it does not mean that the changes will be in the repository until the changes are approved

**Pull** - To get the latest changes from a [repository](#Repository) that's already [cloned](#Clone) with the changes specifically made only on that [branch](#Branch)

**Pull Request** - Proposed changes that users can make to the original [pulled](#Pull) code from a specific branch. Usually, this would also require some reviews from other users when working in a team to be sure that the code follows the necessary guidelines.

**Repository** - A storage location for containing software including user created code, utilities, and different versions of the software.

**Stage** - To setup which changes the user would like to send into the [PR](#Pull_Request) before [pushing](#Push). Similiar to a shopping cart is a place to store and setup which items would want to buy
