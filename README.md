## Oh Fuck It
Vernacular debugging to not forget how to debug stuff because programming can be draining to make things run without errors.  So here's a repo to remember how to do stuff and maybe even teach a few things for how to access various protocols and software without having to google forever and paragraphs for some piece of code.

Send your software issues and updates via the 'Issues' Tab and any everything else to St. Jimmy. They'll straighten everything out.
